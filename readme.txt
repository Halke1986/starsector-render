STARSECTOR RENDERING ENGINE OVERHAUL

This binary mod modifies the vanilla code and improves performance,
typically providing a 100–200% increase in framerate on lower-end GPUs,
especially during battles. The game’s visuals remain the same, with only
the performance improved. Works only with Windows version of Starsector.
