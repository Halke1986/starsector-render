Starsector rendering engine overhaul.

- Binary mod, replaces vanilla jars.
- 100% to 200% FPS increase on poor GPUs, especially in battles.
- Game still looks vanilla, just runs faster.
- Starsector 0.98a-RC8, Windows only.

INSTALLATION

Copy the included .jar files into the starsector-core directory and overwrite the vanilla jars (back them up first if you want to restore later).

Can be added and removed mid-save.
