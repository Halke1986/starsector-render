STARSECTOR RENDERING ENGINE OVERHAUL

This binary mod modifies the vanilla code and improves performance,
typically providing a 100–200% increase in framerate on lower-end GPUs,
especially during battles. The game’s visuals remain the same, with only
the performance improved. Works only with Windows version of Starsector.

INSTALLATION

- Copy the included files into the starsector-core directory.
- Start the game by running fr.bat instead of starsector.exe.
- (Optional) Create a shortcut to fr.bat, and set its icon to FR_SS.ico.
- Can be added and removed mid-save.
